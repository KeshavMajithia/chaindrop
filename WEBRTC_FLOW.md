# WebRTC Connection Flow - ChainDrop

## Fixed Connection Sequence

### Step 1: Sender Uploads File
```
Sender (Browser 1)
  â”œâ”€ Upload file
  â”œâ”€ Generate transferId: "transfer_1761048158927_xxx"
  â”œâ”€ Generate roomId: "room_transfer_1761048158927_xxx"
  â”œâ”€ Connect to signaling server
  â””â”€ Join room: "room_transfer_1761048158927_xxx" as "sender_1761048158928"
```

### Step 2: Receiver Opens Link
```
Receiver (Browser 2)
  â”œâ”€ Open link: /receive/transfer_1761048158927_xxx
  â”œâ”€ Extract transferId from URL
  â”œâ”€ Generate roomId: "room_transfer_1761048158927_xxx" (SAME as sender!)
  â”œâ”€ Connect to signaling server
  â””â”€ Join room: "room_transfer_1761048158927_xxx" as "receiver_1761048169955"
```

### Step 3: Signaling Server Notifies Sender
```
Signaling Server
  â””â”€ Emit "peer-joined" event to sender
     â””â”€ Data: { peerId: "receiver_1761048169955" }
```

### Step 4: Sender Creates WebRTC Peer Connection
```
Sender
  â”œâ”€ Receive "peer-joined" event
  â”œâ”€ Create SimplePeer instance for "receiver_1761048169955" (initiator: true)
  â”œâ”€ SimplePeer generates SDP offer
  â””â”€ Send offer via signaling server
     â””â”€ Message: { type: 'offer', from: 'sender_xxx', to: 'receiver_xxx', data: <SDP> }
```

### Step 5: Receiver Processes Offer
```
Receiver
  â”œâ”€ Receive "signal" event with offer
  â”œâ”€ Create SimplePeer instance for "sender_xxx" (initiator: false)
  â”œâ”€ Process SDP offer
  â”œâ”€ SimplePeer generates SDP answer
  â””â”€ Send answer via signaling server
     â””â”€ Message: { type: 'answer', from: 'receiver_xxx', to: 'sender_xxx', data: <SDP> }
```

### Step 6: Sender Processes Answer
```
Sender
  â”œâ”€ Receive "signal" event with answer
  â”œâ”€ Process SDP answer
  â””â”€ WebRTC connection established! ðŸŽ‰
```

### Step 7: ICE Candidate Exchange (Automatic)
```
Both Peers
  â”œâ”€ Exchange ICE candidates via signaling server
  â”œâ”€ Find best connection path (STUN/TURN)
  â””â”€ Direct P2P data channel opens
```

### Step 8: File Transfer
```
Sender
  â”œâ”€ Wait for "peerConnected" event
  â”œâ”€ Call transferManager.sendFile(file, peerId)
  â”œâ”€ Split file into 16KB chunks
  â”œâ”€ Emit "metadataToSend" event
  â”œâ”€ Send file metadata via data channel { type: 'file-metadata', data: metadata }
  â”œâ”€ Emit "chunkToSend" events
  â”œâ”€ Send chunks via data channel { type: 'file-chunk', data: chunk }
  â””â”€ Track progress

Receiver
  â”œâ”€ Receive file metadata { type: 'file-metadata' }
  â”œâ”€ Call transferManager.receiveFile(metadata, peerId)
  â”œâ”€ Initialize transfer session
  â”œâ”€ Receive chunks { type: 'file-chunk' }
  â”œâ”€ Call transferManager.processChunk(chunk, peerId)
  â”œâ”€ Reassemble file
  â”œâ”€ Verify checksum
  â””â”€ Trigger browser download
```

## Key Points

1. **Same Room**: Both peers MUST join the same room: `room_${transferId}`
2. **Initiator**: Sender creates peer with `initiator: true`, receiver with `initiator: false`
3. **Peer ID**: Sender creates peer connection using receiver's peer ID, not its own
4. **Signaling**: All WebRTC signals (offer, answer, ICE) go through Socket.IO signaling server
5. **Data Channel**: Once connected, file data flows directly P2P (not through server)
